</p><p><em>product design, shared spaces, community interaction</em></p><p>The project “Share-able” aims to re-establish the connection between the public spaces and the people and also among the people in the public spaces. A set of modular and unstable human scale structures, meant to be made stable by sharing. These unstable structures are a kind of social furniture which invokes some kind of social activity among strangers - exchange of words, sharing, concern to help or even an argument. Thus giving a social and playful dimension to the public space experience. The project was successfully implemented at places in and around the Department of Design, IIT Guwahati thus transforming them into active social places.</p><p><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/12306147/Share-able-social-furniture-for-public-spaces" target="_blank">Project Details</a></p>

More often than not, it comprises capitalist and consumerist ideologies. Mass consumption and irresponsible usage are causing a depletion of natural resources. The waste generated from the current mass means of production and consumption is a major cause of climate change and animal extinction. At a time like this, we need to organize ourselves to have a much more holistic and non-exploitative relationship with our environment and not a disruptive one. Our nature is creative, it organizes itself to create conditions to be self-sustaining. Nature is conducive to life. This project follows a research-led design process through which I aim to study animal behavior and organization to speculate scenarios to create systems/narratives/products to invoke a biocentric way of thinking in people.</p>

The project was carried out in two parts: Studying and documenting the two old institutions where food plays a central role in communicating social and religious messages – Langar, the community kitchen of Sikhs and Bhog, the temple food at Doul Gobindo. Designing a food system for today’s context with the intention of reviving our relationship with food. Using food as an object of exchange to create social bonds and value, preserve the diversity of Indian culture and ensure the passing on of this cultural knowledge and tradition to future generations. Besides the conception of this system, the packaging of food as a medium of exchange that envelopes not only the food but also the intangible feelings and emotions of the sender was also proposed, these intangibles are what make the food authentic, communicable and a memory to be cherished forever. Hence the name ‘Food Connect’ was adopted to promote the project’s aim.</p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/95942706" target="_blank">Doul Gobindo</a></p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/95948318" target="_blank">Langar</a></p>

Children are never too young to learn about our cultural heritage and the collections that represent its physical manifestation. Museums simply need to be more enjoyable and more appealing to children. Therein lies the greatest potential. Many people claim that museums are a place for children to have fun, and museum visitor researchers are well aware that this fun experience often leads to learning outcomes. Learning knows no boundaries, and museums can be considered as learning landscapes for children. If learning is viewed as a process of change in knowledge, attitudes, and values, then museums provide an ideal and provocative learning environment. Learning in the museum happens when children connect with interesting objects or experiences. This project is an attempt to understand the different factors that influence children’s experiences in the Assam State Museum and design a solution that would provide a better learning and engaging experience to the children visiting the museum.<br><br></p>

Taking the increasing number of suicides and mental health issues happening nowadays , it is necessary to stay mentally healthy. This project is an exploration of mental wellness and its related facets through our everyday experiences, through the products we use, the spaces that we live in and the experiences we get from our surroundings. The entire process will consider creating mental health awareness and methods to improve our approach towards mental illness. Taking the objects that we use in our daily life, a new design approach is made considering the actions of a stressful mind and ways to relax it through these products. Textures and materials are explored in this project. The expecting Design solution will create experiences to the users which will help them to stay mentally healthy. The final outcome of this project is everyday product concepts with additional stress release features and tactile texture application. 1) Coffee mug with fidget in handle part: this product helps user to engage in fidgeting actions using the small ball attached to the handle. 2)Texture application in computer mouse: Tactile texture sticker concepts for an additional feel and personalisation of mouse according to different users. 3) Easy footrest: Footrest which allows user to rotate or move the top part. Texture created on top of footrest with stones which gives a natural feel to users. The project “Design for Wellbeing” explores the involvement of design through different mediums in mental wellbeing. It is found that there is a scope of new products that help people to tackle basic psychological issues like stress and anxiety through new design approaches. Design can bring new perspectives to psychological issues which people face in their everyday life.</p>

</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">People are becoming increasingly stagnant. A lot of the modern technology we use during large amounts our lives allows, or even requires us to be stagnant. It isolates us, despite the promises of social media. In earlier times, people used to connect through rituals, song and dance. There is a certain experiential quality when content is felt by the body, through movement and action as opposed to just seeing, reading or listening. Through moving, being and performing there is an opportunity for empathy, realization and immersion. The project aims to explore performance as a medium for people to interact with each other in a more visceral, direct and intimate way.</span></p><p>The project will also attempt to take a dramaturgical approach to explore ways to invite people to break away from their current performance, or way of living, and enter different or alien performances. By detaching from the roles that they play (knowingly or unknowingly, whether they choose to play the role or whether the role is demanded of them), people may be able to question their roles, their authenticity and/or achieve a respite from the roles they play every day.</p>

These talks, however, are driven by people’s personal opinions and accusations which certainly do not qualify as credible evidence of bias by these organizations. But the solution can neither be to follow any selected news source, nor to be less informed. It is, to be aware of how the editorial decisions of the sources we choose might be shaping our views. Therefore, there is a need of a data visualization which makes information more accessible and allows readers to form their own opinions. This project visualizes and compares the differences in news delivery by the news organizations of India - Times of India, NDTV, and India TV. The designed visualizations aim to highlight the presence of biases - gatekeeping, coverage, and statement, in the news coverage by Indian media. The scope of the present research is limited to the articles by the Times of India, NDTV, and India TV. These articles are the ones posted in the time period of October 1, 2018 - March 31, 2019 (i.e. 6 months) on the respective websites/web-archives of these news organizations, under the 'India News' section.</p>

Consumer Price Index (CPI) is one such index released by the government. A Consumer Price Index (CPI) is designed to measure the changes over time in general level of retail prices of selected goods and services that households purchase for the purpose of consumption. It is an important indicator of inflation but it is released in the form of datasheets and tables. It is difficult for the public to make sense of it in this format. Some of the visualization tools that are available, are not as sophisticated as the data they represent. On the other hand, other tools are too sophisticated for the common man to make use of them. Therefore, there is a need for a visualization that is sophisticated yet not very complex. There is a need to clarify things rather than simplify them. The designed visualization lies in between the two extremes and encodes the CPI in five different interactive visualizations. These visualizations allow the users to explore all the groups and subgroups of the Index. There is provision to select any of the 27 states and 7 Union territories. The data ranges from Jan 2013 to Jan 2019.</p>

With the influx of digital technologies this notion of the cinema is increasingly challenged and reiterated towards a more meaningful vision of life itself.

The focus is much on the content and not on the filmmaking techniques thus the new degrees of freedom possible are not properly acquainted with this project is about exploring new visual grammar for generating Virtual Reality content. The intention was to understand the new medium of Virtual Reality and all its complexities through exploration. Various aspects of narrative theory and Perceptual Virtuality have been explored as part of this project. We tried to integrate various aspects such as Epistemology of Technology, Media Theory, Human Psychology, and other aspects which could be crucial for the understanding of VR as a new medium. Our final prototype could stand out to be an Avant-Garde film in VR which could help to define the visual, aesthetic and experiential grammar of the medium.

Since time immemorial, India has hosted a plethora of cultures, subcultures and within them hundreds of rituals. As beautiful as it is, a multi cultural society comes with its own conflicts, often due to the gap between different cultures and geographic boundaries. But along with these, arise some unique blends of cultures which are not seen elsewhere. One such case is from the state of Assam. A saint from Sufi school of philosophy, Hazrat Meeran Shah came to Sibsagar region in the 17th Century. More commonly known as Ajan Fakir, his name is still known in the Brahmaputra Valley. Though a Muslim saint, he is known among and respected by both the Hindus as well as the Muslims of Assam. He forged unity among the different sections on the society by his unique devotional songs in Assamese language known as Jikirs. These Jikirs were a blend of local folk songs, Quranic teachings, the philosophy of Srimanta Sankardev. The Jikirs, which also has influences from the geeta, continue to be sung by Assamese people till date. I think that a tale of such an inclusive culture needs to be captured and retold. I aim to create a documentary revolving around this diversity and harmony.</p>

Since its beginning, around Paleolithic age, when the purpose of art was mainly ritualistic and communicational, art has gone through a lot of transformation in its role and significance in society. For a long time, art-forms associated intimately with a medium to experiment and deliver a visual narrative to the viewer for participation and engagement -in order to experience and get a glimpse of an artist's expression. But, with the adoption and proliferation of digital systems and the global shift towards information, contemporary art is witnessing a recent upsurge in the use of various mixed media to deliver that artistic narrative. Apart from the traditional physical medium -canvases, paper, acrylics, charcoal or oil, in essence, other modalities like data, sound and the technological advancement to manipulate the same, have started to come into play and serve the purpose of delivering the artistic narrative to the viewer by serving within the chronologically developed grammar.This project is an attempt at the exploration of these emergent mediums in the information age, within the domain of visual art, and its innate effects on human experience and engagement. This follows an investigative study and experimentation with the discovered medium and an attempt to deliver a narrative using the same</p>

                     <p>2020 | BTP | Avik Biswas</p><p><em>sound, pseudoscience, soundscape, human-nature relationship, synthesis</em></p><p>Sound is a crucial part of our lives. It has its own effects on this universe in all sorts of audible and inaudible levels. Since it is not visible, common people tend not to know about it as much as they would know about light! Keen interest in the field of music and nature has driven me to explore and understand the possibilities and potential of sound on humans and human-nature relationship. Through this project, I want to observe the effects of anthrophony on this world, study to bring out facts from the vanishing ancient, pseudoscientific texts and further find new and meaningful gaps which could be bridged by application of sound in the form of media.</p>
